RedHat / Fedora
================

|st2| RPMs have been tested and precompiled for Fedora 20.

Deployment Script Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


You can download and install the |st2| components, core content, and the accompanying control script by using our one step installer script.  You can download that script from our downloads site with the following command.

::

    curl -q -k -O https://ops.stackstorm.net/releases/st2/scripts/st2_deploy.sh

You can then run the script to download and install the |st2| packages
by simply passing in the version number. If no version number is given, it will default to the latest stable version.

::

    sudo ./st2_deploy.sh

This will download the latest stable build of |st2|.
