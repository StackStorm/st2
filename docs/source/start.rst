Quick Start
=================

Got |st2| :doc:`installed </install/index>`? Enjoyed
:doc:`the intro video <video>`? Let's give it a try.
This guide will walk you through |st2| basics and help you build and run
a simple automation: a rule that triggers an action on external event.


Explore |st2| with CLI
----------------------------
The best way to explore |st2| is to use CLI. Start by firing a few commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    st2 --version
    # Get help. It's a lot. Explore.
    st2 -h
    # List the actions from a 'core' pack
    st2 action list --pack=core
    st2 trigger list
    st2 rule list
    # Run a local shell command
    st2 run core.local -- date -R
    # See the execution results
    st2 execution list
    # Fire a shell comand on remote hosts. Requires passwordless SSH configured.
    st2 run core.remote hosts='localhost' -- uname -a

The default “all-in-one” installation deploys the CLI along with the |st2|
services. CLI can be used to access |st2| service remotely. All |st2|
operations are also available via REST API and Python bindings.
Check the :doc:`CLI and Python Client </reference/cli>` reference for details.

Work with Actions
---------------------

|st2| comes with a several generic actions out of the box.
Action Library can be easily extended by getting actions from the community or consuming
your existing scripts (`more on that later`). Browse Action Library with
``st2 action list``. Action is called by `ref` as ``pack.action_name``
(e.g. ``core.local``). Learn about an action by doing
``st2 action get <action>``, or, ``st2 run <action> --h ( --help)``: it shows
description along with action parameters so that you know how to run it
from the CLI or use it in rules and workflows.


.. code-block:: bash

    # List all the actions in the library
    st2 action list
    # Get action metadata
    st2 action get core.http
    # Display action details and parameters.
    st2 run core.http --help

To run the action from the CLI, do
``st2 run <action> key=value positional arguments``.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run a local command
    st2 run core.local -- uname -a

    # HTTP REST call to st2 action endpoint
    st2 run -j core.http url="http://localhost:9101/actions" method="GET"

Use ``core.remote`` action to run linux command on multiple hosts over ssh.
This assumes that passwordless SSH access is configured for the hosts,
as described in `Configure SSH </install/config.rst#configure-ssh>`__ section.

.. code-block:: bash

    st2 run core.remote host='abc.example.com, cde.example.com' user='mysshuser' -- ls -l

**Note:** for ``core.local`` and ``core.remote`` actions, we use ``--`` to separate action
parameters to ensure that options keys, like ``-l`` or ``-a`` are
properly passed to the action. Alternatively, ``core.local`` and ``core.remote`` actions take
the ``cmd`` parameter to pass crasily complex commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Using `--` to separate arguments
    st2 run core.local -- ls -al
    # Equivalent using `cmd` parameter
    st2 run core.local cmd="ls -al"
    # Crasily complex command passed with `cmd`
    st2 run core.remote hosts='localhost' cmd="for u in bob phill luke; do echo \"Logins by $u per day:\"; grep $u /var/log/secure | grep opened |awk '{print $1 \"-\" $2}' | uniq -c | sort; done;"

Check the action execution history and details of action executions with ``st2 execution`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    # List of executions (recent at the bottom)
    st2 execution list
    # Get execution by ID
    st2 execution get <execution_id>
    # Get the output of just the last execution
    st2 execution list -n 1

That's it. You have learned to use |st2|'s action library. Let's proceed to automations.


Define a Rule
-------------------------

|st2| uses rules to fire actions or workflows when events happen.
Events are typically monitored by sensors. When a sensor catches an event,
it fires a trigger. Trigger trips the rule, the rule checks the criteria
and if it matches, it runs an action. Easy enough. Let’s look at an example.

Sample rule: :github_st2:`sample_rule_with_webhook.yaml
<contrib/examples/rules/sample_rule_with_webhook.yaml>` :

.. literalinclude:: /../../contrib/examples/rules/sample_rule_with_webhook.yaml
    :language: yaml


The rule definition is a YAML spec with thee sections: trigger, criteria, and action.
It configures the webhook trigger with url, applies filtering criteria based trigger
parameters. This one configures a webhook with ``sample`` sub-url so it listens
on ``http://{host}:6001/webhooks/generic/sample``.
When it fires, it appends a payload to the file, only if the ``name``
value in payload is ``st2``. See :doc:`rules` for detailed rule anatomy.

Trigger payload is referred with ``{{trigger}}``. If trigger payload is valid JSON,
it is parsed and can be accessed like ``{{trigger.path.to.parameter}}`` (it's
`Jinga template syntax <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/>`__).

While the most data are retrieved as needed by |st2|, you may need to
store and share some common variables. Use |st2| datastore service to store
the values and reference them in rules and workflows
as ``{{system.my_parameter}}``.

.. code-block:: bash

    st2 key create name=user value=stanley
    st2 key list

What are the triggers availabe to use in rules? Just like with actions,
use the CLI to browse triggers, learn what the trigger does,
how to configure it, and what is it’s payload structure:

.. code-block:: bash

    # List all available triggers
    st2 trigger list

    # Check details on Interval Timer trigger
    st2 trigger get core.st2.IntervalTimer

    # Check details on the Webhook trigger
    st2 trigger get core.st2.webhook


Deploy a Rule
-------------------------

|st2| can be configured to auto-load the rules,
or they are deployed with API or CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

    st2 rule create /usr/share/doc/st2/examples/rules/sample_rule_with_webhook.yaml
    st2 rule list
    st2 rule get examples.webhook_file

Once the rule is created, the webhook begins to listen on
``http://{host}:6001/webhooks/generic/{url}``. Fire the post, check out
the file and see that it appends the payload if the name=Joe.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Post to the webhook
    curl http://localhost:6001/webhooks/generic/sample -d '{"foo": "bar", "name": "st2"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    # Check if the action got executed
    st2 execution list
    # Check that the rule worked
    tail /tmp/st2.webhook_sample.out

Congratulations, your first |st2| rule is up and running!

Basic examples of rules, along with sample actions and sensors can be
found at ``/usr/share/doc/st2/examples/``. To get them deployed, copy them
to /opt/stackstorm/ and reload the content by running ``st2 run packs.load``.
For more content examples checkout `st2contrib`_ community repo on GitHub.


Troubleshooting
----------------------
If something goes wrong:

* Check recent executions: ``st2 execution list``
* Check the logs at ``/var/log/st2.``
* Use service control st2ctl to check service status, restart services, or clean the db.
* `Engage with developers <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=stackstorm>`__
