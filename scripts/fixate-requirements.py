"""
This script is used to automate generation of requirements.txt for st2 components.

The idea behind this script is that that each component has it's own requirements
"in-requirements.txt" file. in-requirements.txt is an input requirements file -
a requirements file with dependencies but WITHOUT any version restrictions.

In addition to this file, there's also the top-level "fixed-requirements.txt"
which pins production versions for the whole st2 stack. During production use
(building, packaging, etc) requirements.txt is generated from in-requirements.txt
where version of packages are fixed according to fixed-requirements.txt.
