# Config file used by Inquiry GC integration tests
#
# This config file exists because the Inquiry GC logic needs access to runners,
# and the current way the config is used means we need our own "base_path" set.
# Please see https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/issues/3775 for more information,
# and please do not use this config file, as it will be deleted as soon as that
# issue is addressed.
