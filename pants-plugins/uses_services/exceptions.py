                you use vagrant for local development with something like:

                vagrant init stackstorm/st2
                vagrant up
                vagrant ssh

                For anyone who wants to attempt local development without vagrant,
                you are pretty much on your own. At a minimum you need to install
                and start {service} with something like:

                are using for development. If you are able, please let us know
