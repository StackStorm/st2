# Add/remove version constraints for transitive dependencies in this file
# (transitive dependencies are dependencies of our direct dependencies).
#
# Direct dependencies should be recorded in `requirements-pants.txt`, not here.

# please document each version constraint as follows:
#
# REQUIRED BY: <package>, <package>, ...
# REASON: <why do we need to constrain this transitive dep?>
# NOTE: <status of this constraint / when can we remove it?>
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: <which version pip resolved without this constraint>
#<package><version constraint>

# ############################################ #
# pinned transitive deps from requirements.txt #
# ############################################ #

# REQUIRED BY: jinja2
# REASON: Fix MarkupSafe to < 2.1.0 as 2.1.0 removes soft_unicode >=0.23 was from jinja2
# NOTE: try to remove constraint later.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: unknown
MarkupSafe<2.1.0,>=0.23

# REQUIRED BY: kombu
# REASON: unknown -- this looks like a lockfile-style pin
# NOTE: try to remove constraint later.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 5.1.1
amqp==5.0.6

# REQUIRED BY: cryptography, paramiko, passlib
# REASON: unknown -- this looks like a lockfile-style pin
# NOTE: try to remove constraint later.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 4.0.1
bcrypt==3.2.0

# REQUIRED BY: bcrypt, cryptography, pynacl, zstandard
# REASON: unknown
# NOTE: try to remove constraint later.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 1.15.1
cffi<1.15.0

# REQUIRED BY: orquesta, prance, requests
# REASON: requests 2.23 requires chardet < 3.1.0
# NOTE: orquesta already constrains this, so this is just documentation.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 3.0.4
#chardet<3.1.0

# REQUIRED BY: jsonpath-rw, networkx
# REASON:
#     networkx requires decorator>=4.3,<5 which should resolve to version 4.4.2
#     but the wheel on pypi does not say it supports python3.8, so pip gets
#     confused. For now, pin decorator to work around pip's confusion.
# NOTE: Since pants/pex use a newer version of pip, this is not an issue.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 4.4.2
#decorator==4.4.2

# REQUIRED BY: eventlet, pymongo
# REASON: 2.0 version breaks pymongo work with hosts
# NOTE: try to remove this later
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 1.16
dnspython>=1.16.0,<2.0.0

# REQUIRED BY: eventlet
# REASON: unknown -- this looks like a lockfile-style pin
# NOTE: We are having a hard time upgrading eventlet, so this pin is commented
#       out to see if that will help. If any tests fail, uncomment this.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 1.1.3.post0
#greenlet==1.0.0

# REQUIRED BY: argcomplete, click, debtcollector, kombu, pluggy, prettytable,
#             pytest, virtualenv
# REASON: unknown
# NOTE: This pinned version (3.10.1) actually conflicts with other requirements.
#       So, it is commented out. If there are issues with newer versions,
#       update this with a range of valid versions.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 4.8.3
#importlib-metadata==3.10.1

# REQUIRED BY: tooz
# REASON: unknown
# NOTE: try to remove constraint later.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 4.13
oslo.utils<5.0,>=4.0.0

# REQUIRED BY: tooz
# REASON: unknown
# NOTE: try to remove constraint later.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 8.1
tenacity>=3.2.1,<7.0.0

# REQUIRED BY: st2-auth-backend-flat-file
# REASON: unknown -- this looks like a lockfile-style pin
# NOTE: st2-auth-backend-flat-file has a version range >=1.7.1,<1.8.0
#       If we need to narrow that range, we should do so in:
#       https://github.com/StackStorm/st2-auth-backend-flat-file/blob/master/requirements.txt
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 1.7.4
#passlib==1.7.4

# pyOpenSSL required by: pymongo[ocsp], redis[ocsp], urllib3[secure]
# but we don't use any of those, so skip copying from fixed-requirements.txt

# REQUIRED BY: httplib2, oslo.utils, packaging
# REASON: unknown -- It looks like <3 was only needed for python2 compatibility.
# NOTE: this is still here, commented, until we can validate that all test are
#       passing without it.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 3.0.7
#pyparsing<3

# REQUIRED BY: async-timeout, gitpython, importlib-metadata, redis
# REASON: importlib-metadata requires typing-extensions but v4.2.0 requires py3.7+
# NOTE: try to remove constraint later.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 4.1.1
typing-extensions<4.2
