# Add/remove version constraints for transitive dependencies in this file
# (transitive dependencies are dependencies of our direct dependencies).
# Then run `./pants generate-lockfiles --resolve=st2` to regenerate the lockfile.
#
# Direct dependencies should be recorded in `requirements-pants.txt`, not here.

# please document each version constraint as follows:
#
# REQUIRED BY: <package>, <package>, ...
# REASON: <why do we need to constrain this transitive dep?>
# NOTE: <status of this constraint / when can we remove it?>
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: <which version pip resolved without this constraint>
#<package><version constraint>

# REQUIRED BY: pytest-cov
# REASON: 7.5 was causing errors with orquesta integration tests
# NOTE: This was probably interaction w/ nose. Try to remove this after switch to pytest.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 7.6.1
coverage<7.5

# pinned transitive deps from requirements.txt #
# ############################################ #

# REQUIRED BY: kombu
# REASON: unknown -- this looks like a lockfile-style pin
#         kombu 5.0.2 requires amqp>=5.0.0,<6.0.0
#         kombu 5.1.0 requires amqp>=5.0.6,<6.0.0
#         kombu 5.2.3 requires amqp>=5.0.9,<6.0.0
#         kombu 5.3.0 requires amqp>=5.1.1,<6.0.0
# NOTE: try to remove constraint later.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 5.1.1 or 5.2.0
#amqp==5.0.6

# REQUIRED BY: cryptography, paramiko, passlib
# REASON: unknown -- this looks like a lockfile-style pin
#         bcrypt 4 is a rewrite in rust and wheels are manylinux2014 instead of manylinux2010
# NOTE: try to remove constraint later.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 4.0.1
#bcrypt==3.2.0

# REQUIRED BY: bcrypt, cryptography, pynacl, zstandard
# REASON: unknown
# NOTE: try to remove constraint later.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 1.15.1
#cffi<1.15.0

# REQUIRED BY: orquesta, prance, requests
# REASON: requests 2.23 requires chardet < 3.1.0
# NOTE: orquesta already constrains this, so this is just documentation.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 3.0.4
#chardet<3.1.0

# REQUIRED BY: jsonpath-rw, networkx
# REASON:
#     networkx requires decorator>=4.3,<5 which should resolve to version 4.4.2
#     but the wheel on pypi does not say it supports python3.8, so pip gets
#     confused. For now, pin decorator to work around pip's confusion.
# NOTE: Since pants/pex use a newer version of pip, this is not an issue.
#       Also, networkx dropped its dependency on decorator in v2.6, and we're
#       using 2.8, so this constraint is pointless now.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 4.4.2
#decorator==4.4.2

# REQUIRED BY: eventlet
# REASON: eventlet is difficult to upgrade.
#         greenlet 2 adds py3.11 support, platform compat changes, and better error checking
#         greenlet 3 adds py3.12 support, drops py3.6 support, fixes various crash conditions
# NOTE: If constrained, bump carefully. Tests seem to be passing without this constraint.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 1.1.3.post0
#greenlet==1.0.0

# REQUIRED BY: argcomplete, click, debtcollector, kombu, pluggy, prettytable,
#             pytest, virtualenv
# REASON: unknown
# NOTE: This pinned version (3.10.1) actually conflicts with other requirements.
#       So, it is commented out. If there are issues with newer versions,
#       update this with a range of valid versions.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 4.8.3
#importlib-metadata==3.10.1

# REQUIRED BY: tooz
# REASON: unknown
# NOTE: try to remove constraint later.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 4.13
#oslo.utils<5.0,>=4.0.0

# REQUIRED BY: tooz
# REASON: unknown
# NOTE: try to remove constraint later.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 8.1
#tenacity>=3.2.1,<7.0.0

# REQUIRED BY: st2-auth-backend-flat-file
# REASON: unknown -- this looks like a lockfile-style pin
# NOTE: st2-auth-backend-flat-file has a version range >=1.7.1,<1.8.0
#       If we need to narrow that range, we should do so in:
#       https://github.com/StackStorm/st2-auth-backend-flat-file/blob/master/requirements.txt
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 1.7.4
#passlib==1.7.4

# pyOpenSSL required by: pymongo[ocsp], redis[ocsp], urllib3[secure]
# but we don't use any of those, so skip copying from fixed-requirements.txt

# REQUIRED BY: httplib2, oslo.utils, packaging
# REASON: unknown -- It looks like <3 was only needed for python2 compatibility.
# NOTE: this is still here, commented, until we can validate that all test are
#       passing without it.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 3.0.7
#pyparsing<3

# REQUIRED BY: async-timeout, gitpython, importlib-metadata, redis
# REASON: importlib-metadata requires typing-extensions but v4.2.0 requires py3.7+
# NOTE: try to remove constraint later.
# DROPS RESOLVED VERSION: 4.1.1
#typing-extensions<4.2
