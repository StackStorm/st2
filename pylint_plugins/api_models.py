Plugin which tells Pylint how to handle classes which define attributes using jsonschema
in "schema" class attribute.

Those classes dyamically assign attributes defined in the schema on the class inside the
constructor.

Pylint uses static analysis on the python files it lints. This means that it does not
import any of the code using standard python libraries. Instead, it parses them into an
AST using the astroid library. Thus, it is safe to run Pylint on code that would
have import time side-effects without triggering those effects. When parsing a single file,
Pylint can parse the direct dependencies of that file without following the entire
import chain, which might include significant transient dependencies in 3rd party libraries.

Since pylint is using an AST instead of importing the code, it cannot know about the dynamic
attributes that get added to our API model classes. Plus, the schema itself is often
constructed by including copies of common sub schemas. So, the attributes are dynamic AND
the schemas that define those attributes are also dynamic.

So, in this plugin we have to do a bit of work to:

  1) extract the "schema =" assignment,
  2) parse the assigned value to find any other variables used in the schema object,
  3) extract the assignments for those other variables, and
  4) construct a final dictionary AST node that includes all the attributes that
     Pylint needs to know about on our model classes.

At this point, we have the schema, so then we:

  5) iterate over the schema properties,
  6) parse each property's value to find any other referenced variables,
  7) extract the assignments for those referenced variables,
  8) inspect the types of those properties (str, int, list, etc), and
  9) add new attribute AST nodes (of the appropriate type) to the class AST node.

Now, we return because Pylint can finally understand our API model objects without
importing them.
