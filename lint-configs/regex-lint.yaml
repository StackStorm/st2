# Note that for values that are regexes, how YAML interprets backslashes and other
# special characters matters. For example, an unquoted string is interpreted as a raw
# string with no escape characters (so it's particularly useful for expressing regexes).
# Adding quotes around these may change their meaning, so don't do so without thought.

  # TODO: In the future pants should get `visibility` and possibly other
  #       features to restrict imports for dependees or dependencies.

  #       When that happens, we can add that target metadata,
  #       and remove these regex based dependency checks.
