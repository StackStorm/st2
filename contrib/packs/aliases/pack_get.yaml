        Getting back to you about the `{{ execution.parameters.pack }}` pack:{~}
        {% if execution.result.pack %}
          Here's the full index entry for the pack:
          ```
          {{ execution.result.pack }}
          ```
          Its source code is available at {{ execution.result.pack.repo_url }}.

          To install the pack:
          ```
          pack install {{ execution.parameters.pack }}
          ```
          If the pack is already installed, I will upgrade it to the latest version, keeping the config.
        {% else %}
          There's nothing like that in the pack index.
          I know how sad it is, but life goes on. Cheer up!
