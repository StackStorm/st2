        A sample workflow that demonstrates how to set the concurrency option
        in with-items to throttle the number of action executions that get
        run simultaneously. Currently in this release, the concurrency option
        does not work with YAQL expression.
    type: direct
    input:
        - cmd
        - count
    tasks:
        repeat:
            with-items: i in <% list(range(0, $.count)) %>
            concurrency: 2
            action: core.local
            input:
                cmd: "<% $.cmd %>; sleep 3"
            publish:
                result: <% task(repeat).result.select($.stdout) %>
