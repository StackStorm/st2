# JSON schema for pack contents

The JSON files under this directory are auto-generated by st2-generate-schemas. To update the
schema files, run `make schemasgen`. Please do not edit these files manually.

The purpose of these schema files are used for validation of pack contents during pack development.
Development tools (i.e. VSCode extension) will need to be developed to take advantage of these
schema files.
