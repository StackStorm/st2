Managing Python dependencies
----------------------------

.. note::

    ``requirements.txt`` files are generated automatically using
    ``scripts/fixate-requirements.py`` script and should't be editeed manually.

To manage Python dependencies for each StackStorm component, we use the
following files:

1. ``fixed-requirements.txt`` - A file which pins all the requirements to a
   specific version. Keep in mind that this file is used by all the components.
   This way we make sure different components always use the same version of a
   particular dependency.
2. ``st2*/in-requirements.txt`` - Component specific requirements file. This
   file contains a full list of the dependencies which are needed by this
   particular component.
3. ``st2*/requirements.txt`` - Final component requirements file which is
   generated by processing fixed-requirements.txt and in-requirements.txt file.
   Note: This file is automatically generated and should not be edited
   manually.
4. ``requirements.txt`` - Final requirements file for all the components which
   is generated by processing fixed-requirements.txt and all the component
   in-requirements.txt files. Note: This file is automatically generated and
   should not be edited manually.

Adding a new component dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a new dependency for a particular component, you should perform the following steps:

1. Add a name / link to the dependency to component ``in-requirements.txt``
   fire. For example ``st2actions/in-requirements.txt``
2. Pin this requirement to a specific version in ``fixed-requirements.txt``
   file.
3. Generate final ``requirements.txt`` file for that component by running
   ``make requirements`` target in the component directory. For example:
   ``cd st2actions ; make requirements``.
4. Add a commit generated requirements.txt file.
