StackStorm CLI and Python Client
================================

Install from Source
-------------------

Git clone the StackStorm repo locally, change directory to st2client, then
run "python setup.py install".

Endpoint Configuration
----------------------

By default, both the python client and the CLI will retrieve endpoint
configuration from the environment. If no configuration is provided, the
client will assume localhost and default ports.

-  ST2\_BASE\_URL - Base URL for the StackStorm API server endpoints (i.e.
   http://localhost). If only the base URL is provided, the client will
   assume default ports for the API servers are used. If any of the API
   server URL is provided, it will override the base URL and default
   port.
-  ST2\_API\_URL - Endpoint for the Action REST API (i.e.
   https://example.com/api) for managing actions, executions, triggers,
   rules and reusable configuration data.

The default endpoint configuration can be explicitly specified at the
StackStorm CLI and the python client. For StackStorm CLI, the endpoints are provided
via optional parameters (i.e. --url for base URL, --action-url,
--reactor-url, and --datastore-url). For the python client, the
endpoints are provided via the Client init as kwargs (i.e. base\_url,
action\_url, reactor\_url, and datastore\_url).

CLI
---

CLI is developed using standard python argparse and uses well known
pattern for commands and subcommands. In general, trigger, rule, action,
and key are commands and list, get, create, update, and delete are
subcommands. The command run and execution are special cases and do not
have the same set of subcommands. Please use the CLI help option for
more detail description.

-h or --help option is used to display usage information.

::

    st2 -h
    st2 action -h
    st2 action create -h
    st2 run -h
    st2 run <action-name> -h

-j or --json option will format output as JSON.

::

    st2 rule get <rule-name> -j

-a or --attr option allows user to specify which attributes to display
and in which order.

::

    st2 rule get <rule-name> -a name description

-w or --width option lets user specify the width of table columns. If
only 1 value is provided, all table columns will have the same width. By
default, the width is 28.

::

    st2 rule list -a name description -w 50
    st2 rule list -a name description -w 25 50

Python Client
-------------

::

    >>> from st2client.client import Client
    >>> from st2client import models
    >>> client = Client(base_url='http://localhost')
    >>> rules = client.rules.get_all()
    >>> key_value_pair = client.keys.update(models.KeyValuePair(name='k1', value='v1'))

The models Trigger, Rule, Action, Execution, and KeyValuePair are
defined under st2client.models. Please refer to the respective README
section for these models for their schema.

The resource managers for the models are instantiated under the client
as **triggers**, **rules**, **actions**, **executions**, and **keys**.
The operations get\_all, get\_by\_name, get\_by\_id, create, update, and
delete are generally implemented for these resource managers.

-  **get\_all** returns a list of resource instances.
-  **get\_by\_name** and **get\_by\_id** takes name and id respectively
   and returns the matching resource instance.
-  **create** takes a resource instance as input and creates the
   instance, throwing unique constraint error if name already exists
-  **update** takes a resource instance as input and updates the
   instance matching by name
-  **delete** takes a resource instance as input and deletes the
   instance matching by name
