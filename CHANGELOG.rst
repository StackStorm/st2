Changelog
=========

v0.8dev - Under development
---------------------------

Docs: http://docks.stackstorm.com/latest

* Allow user to specify current working directory (``cwd`` parameter) when running actions using the
  local or the remote runner (``run-local``, ``run-local-script``, ``run-remote``,
  ``run-remote-script``). (new-feature)
* Default values of the parameter of an Action can be system values stored in kv-store. (new-feature)
* Allow users to specify additional paths where StackStorm looks for integration packs using
  ``packs_base_paths`` setting. (new-feature)
* Allow user to specify which Python binary to use for the Python runner actions using
  ``actionrunner.python_binary`` setting (new-feature)
* Default Python binary which is used by Python runner actions to be the Python binary which is
  used by the action runner service. Previous, system's default Python binary was used.
* Fix a race-condition / bug which would occur when multiple packs are installed at the same time.
  (bug-fix)
* Vars can be defined in the ActionChain. (new-feature)
* Node in an ActionChain can publish global variables. (new-feature)
* Allow user to provide authentication token either inside headers (``X-Auth-Token``) or via
  ``x-auth-token`` query string parameter. (new-feature)
* Allow actions without parameters. (bug-fix)
* Fix a bug with rule matching not working for any triggers with parameters. (bug-fix)
* Require ``cmd`` parameter for the following actions: ``core.remote``, ``core.remote_sudo``,
  ``core.local``, ``core.local_sudo`` (bug-fix)
* Allow user to override authentication information (username, password, private key) on per
  action basis for all the remote runner actions. (new-feature)
* Allow user to pass ``--inherit-env`` flag to the ``st2 action run`` command which causes all
  the environment variables accessible to the CLI to be sent as ``env`` parameter to the action
  being executed. (new-feature)
* Cast params of an execution before scheduling in the RulesEngine. This allows non-string
  parameters in an action. (new-feature)
* Use QuerySet.count() instead of len(QuerySet) to avoid the caching of the entire result which
  improve running time of API request. (bug-fix)
* CLI commands to return non-zero exit codes for failed operations (new-feature)
* Fix a bug with template rendering, under some conditions, ending in an infinite loop. (bug-fix)

v0.7 - January 16, 2015
-----------------------

Docs: http://docks.stackstorm.com/0.7/

* Python runner and all the fabric based runners (``run-local``, ``run-local-script``,
  ``run-remote``, ``run-remote-script``) now expose ``timeout`` argument. With this argument
  user can specify action timeout. Previously, the action timeout was not user-configurable and
  a system-wide default value was used.
* The time when an action execution has finished is now recorded and availabla via the
  ``end_timestamp`` attribute on the ``ActionExecution`` model.
* Status code 400 (bad request) is now returned if user doesn't provide a body to API endpoints
  which require it. Previously 500 internal server error was returned (bug-fix).
* Refactor local runners so they are more robust, efficient and easier to debug. Previously, local
  actions were executed through SSH, now they are executed directly without the overhead of SSH.
* Fix local runner so it correctly executes a command under the provider system user if ``user``
  parameter is provided. (bug-fix)
* Fix a bug with a Trigger database object in some cases being created twice when registering a
  rule. (bug-fix)
* Fix a bug with child processes which run sensor code not being killed when stopping a sensor
  container service. (bug-fix)
* Fix a bug and allow user to use non-ascii (unicode) values in the parameter substitution values.
  (bug-fix)
* Allow polling sensors to retrieve current poll interval and change it using ``get_poll_interval``
  and ``set_poll_interval`` methods respectively. (new-feature)
* Add support for a ``standalone`` mode to the st2auth service. In the standalone mode,
  authentication is handled inside the st2auth service using the defined backend. (new feature)
* Timer is not a sensor anymore. It is spun as part of rules_engine process (refactor)
* Fix a bug with action registration where action with invalid schema for
  parameters get registered. (bug-fix)
* Fix a bug with 'default' param values inheritance in runner/actions. (bug-fix)
* Add new rule criteria comparison operators: ``iequals``, ``contains``, ``icontains``,
  ``ncontains``, ``incontains``, ``startswith``, ``istartswith``, ``endswith``, ``iendswith``
  (new-feature)
* Allow sensors to store temporary data in the datastore using the ``get_value``, ``set_value`` and
  ``delete_value`` methods exposed by sensor_service. (new-feature)
* Allow user to specify TTL for datastore values by sending ``ttl`` attribute in the body of a
  `PUT /keys/<key id>` request. (new feature)
* Add new `key delete_by_prefix --prefix=<prefix>` client command. This command allows deletion of
  all the keys which name starts with the provided prefix. (new-feature)
* Add ability to attach tags to Action, Rule and TriggerType.
* Add ability to query results asynchronously from external services. (new-feature)
* Action models now use ContentPackResourceMixin so we can get them by ref. (refactor)
* Add ``rule_tester`` tool which allows users to test rules in an offline mode without any services
  running (new-feature)
* Fix a bug where trigger objects weren't created for triggers with different parameters. (bug-fix)
* st2api only requires st2common and dependencies defined in requirements to be available on the
  pythonpath thus making it possible to run st2api standalone.

v0.6.0 - December 8, 2014
-------------------------

Docs: http://docs.stackstorm.com/0.6.0/

* Separate virtualenv per pack. (Pythonic sensors and actions use them by default.)
* Install pip requirements from requiremets.txt in packs by default.
* Sensors are now run in their own process for isolation.
* Python Actions are now run in their own process for isolation.
* Add Sensor and PollingSensor base classes. (Sensors API change is non-backward compatible.)
* Separate out rules_engine into own process.
* YAML support for action, rules and chain meta.
* Add sensor meta support (JSON/YAML) to specify trigger types.
* Packs default path moves from /opt/stackstorm to /opt/stackstorm/packs/.
* Webhooks are not part of a sensor. They are now part of core API. (Authentication may
  be required.)
* API URLs are now versioned. All the existing paths have been prefixed with ``/v1``
  (e.g. ``/v1/actions``).
* Audit log messages are now saved in a structured format as JSON in
  ``st2actionrunner.{pid}.audit.log`` log file.
* Numerous bug fixes.

v0.5.1 - November 3rd, 2014
