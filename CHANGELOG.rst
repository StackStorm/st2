Changelog
=========

0.13.3 - TBD
------------

* Allow user to select ``keystone`` backend in the st2auth service. (bug-fix)
* Fix ``packs.info`` action so it correctly exists with a non-zero status code if the pack doesn't
  exist or if it doesn't contain a valid ``.gitinfo`` file. (bug-fix)
* Fix ``packs.info`` action so it correctly searches all the packs base dirs. (bug-fix)

0.13.2 - September 09, 2015
---------------------------

* Private_key supplied for remote_actions is now used to auth correctly. private_key argument
  should be the contents of private key file (of user specified in username argument). (bug-fix)
* Last newline character ('\n') is now stripped from ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` fields in local
  and remote command/shell runners. (improvement)
* Fix sensor container service so the ``config`` argument is correctly passed to the sensor
  instances in the system packs. Previously, this argument didn't get passed correctly to the
  FileWatchSensor from the system linux pack. (bug-fix)
* Make sure sensor processes correctly pick up parent ``--debug`` flag. This makes debugging a lot
  easier since user simply needs to start sensor container with ``--debug`` flag and all the sensor
  logs with level debug or higher will be routed to the container log. (improvement)

0.13.1 - August 28, 2015
------------------------

* cwd for paramiko script runner should use cwd provided as runner parameter. (bug-fix)
* Fix timer regression; bring brake broken timers. (bug-fix)
* Updates to trace objects are done via non-upsert updates by adding to the array. This
  makes it safer to update trace objects from multiple processes. (bug-fix)

0.13.0 - August 24, 2015
------------------------

* Add new OpenStack Keystone authentication backend.
  [Itxaka Serrano]
* Information about parent workflow is now a dict in child's context field. (improvement)
* Fix a bug when some runner parameter default values where not overridden when a
  falsey value was used in the action metadata parameter override (e.g. False, 0).
  [Eugen C.]
* Correctly return 404 if user requests an invalid path which partially maps to an existing
  path. (bug-fix)
* Add support for restarting sensors which exit with a non-zero status code to
  the sensor container. Sensor container will now automatically try to restart
  (up to 2 times) sensor processes which die with a non-zero status code. (improvement)
* Support for RabbitMQ cluster. StackStorm works with a RabbitMQ cluster and switches
  nodes on failover. (feature)
* Add index to the ActionExecution model to speed up query. (improvement)
* Fix sort key in the ActionExecution API controller. (bug-fix)
* Introduce a Paramiko SSH runner that uses eventlets to run scripts or commands in parallel. (improvement) (experimental)
* Add action parameters validation to Mistral workflow on invocation. (improvement)
* Fix key name for error message in liveaction result. (bug-fix)
* Fix 500 API response when rule with no pack info is supplied. (bug-fix)
* Fix bug in trigger-instance re-emit (extra kwargs passed to manager is now handled). (bug-fix)
* Rename notification "channels" to "routes". (improvement)
* Make sure auth hook and middleware returns JSON and "Content-Type: application/json" header
  in every response. (improvement, bug-fix)
* Fix bug in triggers emitted on key value pair changes and sensor spawn/exit. When
  dispatching those triggers, the reference used didn't contain the pack names
  which meant it was invalid and lookups in the rules engine would fail. (bug-fix)
* Allow user to include files which are written on disk inside the action create API payload.
  (new feature)
* Allow user to retrieve content of a file inside a pack by using the new
  ``/packs/views/files/`` API endpoint. (new feature)

* Add ability to add trace tag to ``st2 run`` CLI command. (feature)
* Add ability to specify trace id in ``st2 run`` CLI command. (feature)
* Update ``st2ctl`` to correctly start ``st2web`` even if even if Mistral is no installed.
  (bug-fix, improvement)
* Add X-Request-ID header to all API calls for easier debugging. (improvement)
* Add new CLI commands for disabling and enabling content pack resources
  (``{sensor,action,rule} {enable, disable} <ref or id>``) (feature)
* Fix a bug in handling positional arguments with spaces. (bug-fix)
* Make sure that the ``$PATH`` environment variable which is set for the sandboxed Python
  process contains "<virtualenv path>/bin" directory as the first entry. (bug fix)

0.12.2 - August 11, 2015.
-------------------------

-----------------------

Docs: http://docks.stackstorm.com/0.7/

* Python runner and all the fabric based runners (``run-local``, ``run-local-script``,
  ``run-remote``, ``run-remote-script``) now expose ``timeout`` argument. With this argument
  user can specify action timeout. Previously, the action timeout was not user-configurable and
  a system-wide default value was used.
* The time when an action execution has finished is now recorded and available via the
  ``end_timestamp`` attribute on the ``ActionExecution`` model.
* Status code 400 (bad request) is now returned if user doesn't provide a body to API endpoints
  which require it. Previously 500 internal server error was returned (bug-fix).
* Refactor local runners so they are more robust, efficient and easier to debug. Previously, local
  actions were executed through SSH, now they are executed directly without the overhead of SSH.
* Fix local runner so it correctly executes a command under the provider system user if ``user``
  parameter is provided. (bug-fix)
* Fix a bug with a Trigger database object in some cases being created twice when registering a
  rule. (bug-fix)

* Fix a bug with action registration where action with invalid schema for
  parameters get registered. (bug-fix)

  ``ncontains``, ``incontains``, ``startswith``, ``istartswith``, ``endswith``, ``iendswith``
  (new-feature)
* Allow sensors to store temporary data in the datastore using the ``get_value``, ``set_value`` and
  ``delete_value`` methods exposed by sensor_service. (new-feature)
* Allow user to specify TTL for datastore values by sending ``ttl`` attribute in the body of a
  `PUT /keys/<key id>` request. (new feature)

  all the keys which name starts with the provided prefix. (new-feature)

* Add ability to query results asynchronously from external services. (new-feature)
* Action models now use ContentPackResourceMixin so we can get them by ref. (refactor)
* Add ``rule_tester`` tool which allows users to test rules in an offline mode without any services
  running (new-feature)

* Install pip requirements from requiremets.txt in packs by default.
* Sensors are now run in their own process for isolation.

  be required.)
* API URLs are now versioned. All the existing paths have been prefixed with ``/v1``
  (e.g. ``/v1/actions``).
