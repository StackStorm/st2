"""
Migration which which migrates data for existing objects in the database which utilize
EscapedDictField or EscapedDynamicField and have been updated to use new JsonDictField.

Migration step is idempotent and can be retried on failures / partial runs.

Keep in mind that running this migration script is optional and it may take a long time of you have
a lot of very large objects in the database (aka executions) - reading a lot of data from the
database using the old field types is slow and CPU intensive.

New field type is automatically used for all the new objects when upgrading to v3.5 so migration is
optional because in most cases users are viewing recent / new executions and not old ones which may
still utilize old field typo which is slow to read / write.

Right now the script utilizes no concurrency and performs migration one object by one. That's done
for simplicity reasons and also to avoid massive CPU usage spikes when running this script with
large concurrency on large objects.

Keep in mind that only "completed" objects are processes - this means Executions in "final" states
(succeeded, failed, timeout, etc.).

We determine if an object should be migrating using mongodb $type query (for execution objects we
could also determine that based on the presence of result_size field).
