StackStorm command for installing a pack and setting up pack virtual environment on the local
system where the command runs.

This command is meant to be used in Docker and similar environments where container / server
where the pack is installed doesn't have access to the database (MongoDB) and message bus
(RabbitMQ).

Keep in mind that pack still eventually needs to be registered in the database by running
"st2ctl reload --register-all" command on a server with access to the database and message bus.

NOTE: Ideally for this command to work, whole StackStorm package would be installed on the
system, but at the very least, the following things need to be present:

    * Python 2.7 / 3.x with a recent virtualenv binary
    * st2common StackStorm Python package
    * /etc/st2/st2.conf config file (user can specify custom pack exchange index, settings there,
      etc.)

import sys

from st2common.cmd import install_pack
